<h4>Lab 01  </h4> <br>
These file defines a base class for various shapes in Java, encapsulating common properties and behaviors. Key concepts include encapsulation, using private fields with public getters and setters, and abstraction, with abstract methods for subclasses to implement. <br>
Majorly represents an employee in Java, emphasizing encapsulation and class design. It features private fields with public getters and setters, overloaded constructors for flexible object creation, and supports potential polymorphism for subclass-specific behaviors. <br>
<br> <b>Task 01 : </b> a Student class with private attributes: roll number, name, email, and address. Implement default, parameterized, and copy constructors, as well as setter and getter methods. Include inputData() and showData() methods for user input and data display. <br>
<b>Task 02 : </b>  a Shape class with area and volume attributes. Include default, parameterized, and copy constructors, a getInput() method using GUI components, and an overridden toString() method. Extend this class with Square (attributes: width, length, height) and Sphere (attributes: radius, Pi) subclasses, overriding getInput() and toString() methods. <br>

<h4>Lab 02  </h4> To build a graphical calculator in Java, you'll use components like a main window (frame), input fields (for numbers), buttons (for operations like add, subtract, multiply, divide), and event handlers (to manage user interactions). Input values are converted from text to numbers for calculations using Java's parsing methods. This approach allows for creating an interactive calculator interface in Java applications. <br>
<hr>
<h4>Lab 03  </h4> creating an abstract class TwoDimensionalShape with an abstract getArea() method. Subclasses Circle, Square, and Triangle will extend TwoDimensionalShape, each implementing getArea() to compute its area of Square and Triangle). Override the toString() method in each subclass to describe the shape.

<h4>Lab 04  </h4> <br>
<b>Task 01 : </b>Define a Customer class with attributes, Use a Bank class to manage customers using either ArrayList or a simple array. Implementations of methods 
and throwing exceptions when necessary. throwing invalid if not found. <br>
<b>Task 02 : </b>The Health class computes BMI based on user inputs for weight and height, while the Driver class provides functionalities to save and retrieve data from an array of health records. Implement exception handling to manage scenarios such as negative array sizes and index occupancy <br>
<hr>
<h4>Lab 05  </h4>  <br>
<b>Task 01 : </b>  To manage bank accounts using a Bank class. Implement functionalities to add new accounts with default balances, and transfer funds between accounts stored in a file using a switch-based menu. Ensure proper exception handling, including noAccountAvailableException for invalid recipient records. Utilize semicolons as separators in the file format for account data.
<br>
<b>Task 02 : </b> Reading writing from a file , Employee class with attributes id, name, salary, and rank. Functions include reading from CSV, adding, writing to TXT files, and removing records based on ID using a switch menu in the Driver class.<br>
<hr>
<h4>Lab 06  </h4>  Create a Words class with attributes for word name and meaning, along with constructors and getter/setter methods. Implement a Dictionary class using a HashMap to store word-meaning pairs, with functions to insert records and find meanings based on user input. <br>
<hr>
<h4>Lab 07  </h4> Develop a multi-threaded Java application to read data from multiple files concurrently. Implement a ReadFile class with a constructor to specify file names and a run() method for file reading.

<h4>Lab 10  </h4> dynamic form with onblur and onsubmit properties enhances user interaction and validation in web applications. <br>
<hr>
<h4>Lab 11  </h4> Create a functional calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Design buttons for numbers, operators, and clear functions in HTML, style with CSS for a modern look, and use JavaScript for logic to handle user inputs, perform calculations, and update results dynamically on the interface.

<h3>Car Rental System</h3> <br>
The Java-based car rental system integrates servlets, session management, JSP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to deliver a robust web application. Servlets manage backend logic, handling user requests and database interactions. Session management ensures secure user sessions for tasks like booking cars and maintaining user profiles. JSP facilitates dynamic content generation, rendering HTML pages with embedded Java code. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript collectively create an interactive front-end, enabling features such as car search, booking, and user profile management.<br>
